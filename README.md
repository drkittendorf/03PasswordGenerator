Homework 3 Password Generator
Completed prompt for number of characters, including validation.
Completed confirm for upper and lower characters, numbers and special characters.
After completing the entire project entirely at the global level, I went back and reconstructed using functions.

Clicking the button will generate a secure password.
When you visit the site and click generate password
it will prompt for number of characters.
It will only accept a number between 8 and 128
if you attempt other characters it will re-prompt.
It will confirm whether the user would like 
lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
If user doesn't select any of the character options, it will re-prompt the user
to select at least one character type.
Once the selections have been made a password is generated, alerts to the page and is then printed in the password generator box.

I made a few minor customizations of the css.
